                <h2>Anomaly Detection</h2>
                <p>One of the major projects I worked on was the Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Detection System. FOD’s are any objects found inside of an aircraft that should not be left there, such as spare tools, safety goggles, or even a lighter. When I noticed that FOD’s are seemingly harmless but can be detrimental to an aircraft, what started simply as an idea became a full scale project with the end goal of creating some sort of system to detect possible FOD’s. Pursuing a project I was very passionate about at the office made me learn a great deal on working with Artificial Intelligence, automation, and even sharpened my Python skills. I also was able to work with technology I had never even heard of before, like Raspberry PI and OpenCV. It was quite a journey to have gone from formulating a cool idea, to doing an incredible amount of research, to putting in the work and finally watching it all come to fruition, and that kind of learning and experience was invaluable.<br><br>A frame of this project running is shown in the figure above. In my hands, I hold a lighter and a screwdriver, which are both FOD’s. The trained AI model is able to detect these objects, identify them, and produce a percentage on how confident it is that the identification is correct.</p>

                <h2>Non-Conformance Reports</h2>
                <p>In the making of an aircraft, the trajectory of creation is never a steady incline, and because it is inevitable that delays and issues will be raised, the better the workers communicate, the quicker there can be a solution. Non-conformance reports, or NCR’s for short, are what the production team raises whenever there is an issue with a part in the aircraft, and the Methods team is the in-between to liaise these NCR’s to the Quality Assurance team, and receive feedback on what the next step is. My role allowed me to accurately depict what the NCR’s being sent from Production were, and organize them in a manner that can be easily transferred to Quality Assurance. I also learned a great deal of Excel, by outputting the NCR’s from the dashboard onto a spreadsheet and organizing them in a manner that can be presented in team meetings. I took it a step further by diving into a mini-project, which gathered all the NCR’s across all the aircrafts and graphed them on a weekly basis in an automated manner, showcasing trends in how the raised NCR’s are being closed as the weeks progress. This display of trends became a wide success not only in team meetings, but also quite simply in the closing of NCR’s.</p>

                <h2>Project Management</h2>
                <p>Working as a software developer intern seemed like I would be bound to all things software, but in actuality I dove into many different fields. While working with aircrafts led to a great deal of focus on aerospace, I also worked on projects of varying lengths, and thus learned about project management. The making of an aircraft has become fairly predictable and repetitive, and thus my role in the Methods team, viewing each aircraft as an individual project meant I had a timeline written out for me. However when it came to working on my own projects, I had no idea on what kind of time and effort it would require to see the project through. Theorizing a rough timeline that I could bring to my supervisor quickly fell apart the moment I hit a hiccup, be it from reaching a sticking point in the project, or be it from the inability to produce any spare time to work on the project because it was a busy day of NCR’s at the office. Due to this, I began to understand how to best manage my time, and more to the point, how to manage a project. I learned the importance of creating buffers within a project timeline, accounting for any possible delays, as well as how to be realistic with formulating a completion date. I also went the extra mile by researching features of project management, such as a scope, time and budget, and constructed a timeline I could not only use to visually showcase the project to my supervisor, but to also aid me in adhering to my goals and keeping myself accountable.</p>

                <h2>AI Chatbot Development</h2>
                <p>One of the key projects I took on was the creation of an AI chatbot for the Broil King website. This chatbot was designed to assist users by answering questions related to Broil King barbeque grills and their features. To achieve this, I trained a model that could efficiently navigate through a vast amount of data specific to the company’s product line. One of the biggest challenges was restricting the chatbot’s knowledge base solely to the information available on the Broil King website. By limiting its responses, I ensured that users received accurate answers grounded in the company's actual product information without the risk of outside data skewing the results. This task allowed me to grow my knowledge in AI, machine learning, and natural language processing, as well as hone my Python programming skills. Bringing this project to life required persistence and meticulous testing, but seeing the chatbot successfully assist customers was immensely rewarding.</p>

                <h2>Dynamic FAQ Page</h2>
                <p>In addition to the chatbot, I developed a dynamic FAQ page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The challenge here was to work outside the existing WordPress and PHP-based infrastructure that the website was originally built on. Instead of refactoring legacy code, I focused on building a stand-alone page that could guide users to the ideal grill. The FAQ page utilized a multi-level filtering system, allowing users to navigate through various features such as grill size, fuel type, and cooking preferences to receive a personalized product suggestion. This project not only sharpened my front-end development skills but also allowed me to creatively tackle UX/UI challenges. The page became a valuable tool for both customers and the marketing team by streamlining the purchasing decision-making process. I was proud to see it being actively used and well-received by both teams.</p>

                <p>Working as a web developer, I initially had no idea what to expect, but the opportunity to work independently and closely with the CEO allowed me to grow immensely in both technical and interpersonal skills. From working on complex code to communicating project progress across teams, I became adept at problem-solving in real time. With frequent interactions with departments not only in Canada but also in the US, Germany, the UK, and other countries, I learned how to effectively collaborate across borders. One of my most valuable contributions was keeping track of website-related issues raised by various teams, prioritizing them based on urgency, and ensuring that they were completed in a timely manner. The combination of my technical work, along with the communication and coordination skills I developed, left me with a deep appreciation for the complexities of web development within a global enterprise.</p>
